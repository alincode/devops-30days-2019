# 服務 (Service)

前一篇我們只做到把 Pod 建立起來，但如果要讓 Pod 之間可以互相溝通，或讓人從外部跟存取叢集，還需要建立 Service 物件才行。

儘管每個 Pod 有一個獨立的 IP 位址，但這些都是只是虛擬 IP (virtual IP)，如果沒有 Service 物件的協助，我們還是無法從外部來接觸到這些資源。

如果說第一步是建立 deployment 物件，那建立 Service 物件，肯定就是第二步驟了。

### Service 的類型

- ClusterIP（預設）：使用內部的 IP 來公開服務，需搭配類似 ingress 才能取得 public IP。
- NodePort：使用 NAT 方式來公開服務，例如 `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`。
- LoadBalancer：使用雲端的 Load balancer，Service 可以配派到一個 public IP。
- ExternalName

## 建立一個 nginx deployment

建立一個 nginx-deployment

```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image nginx

# 輸出結果
# deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

查看 deployment

```sh
kubectl get deployment

# 輸出結果
# NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
# nginx-deployment   1/1     1            1           72s
```

## 建立一個 nginx service

替這個 deployment 建立一個 service

```sh
kubectl expose deploy nginx-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --name=nginx-service
```

查看 service

```sh
kubectl get svc/nginx-service

# 輸出結果
# NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)        AGE
# nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.15.241.2   107.167.176.121   80:32566/TCP   65s
```

或用 yaml 的方式來建立 service 物件

```
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: nginx-deployment
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx-deployment
```

### kubectl explain svc

```
KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Service is a named abstraction of software service (for example, mysql)
     consisting of local port (for example 3306) that the proxy listens on, and
     the selector that determines which pods will answer requests sent through
     the proxy.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion   <string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind <string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata     <Object>
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata

   spec <Object>
     Spec defines the behavior of a service.
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

   status       <Object>
     Most recently observed status of the service. Populated by the system.
     Read-only. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status
```

### kubectl explain svc.spec

```
KIND:     Service
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Spec defines the behavior of a service.
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

     ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service.

FIELDS:
   clusterIP    <string>
     clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly
     by the master. If an address is specified manually and is not in use by
     others, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise, creation of the
     service will fail. This field can not be changed through updates. Valid
     values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address. "None" can be
     specified for headless services when proxying is not required. Only applies
     to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is
     ExternalName. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

   externalIPs  <[]string>
     externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will
     also accept traffic for this service. These IPs are not managed by
     Kubernetes. The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a
     node with this IP. A common example is external load-balancers that are not
     part of the Kubernetes system.

   externalName <string>
     externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will
     return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved.
     Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and
     requires Type to be ExternalName.

   externalTrafficPolicy        <string>
     externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route external
     traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the
     client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type
     services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster"
     obscures the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node,
     but should have good overall load-spreading.

   healthCheckNodePort  <integer>
     healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the service. If
     not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api backend
     with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if
     specified by the client. Only effects when Type is set to LoadBalancer and
     ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.

   loadBalancerIP       <string>
     Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get created
     with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the
     underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a
     load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider
     does not support the feature.

   loadBalancerSourceRanges     <[]string>
     If specified and supported by the platform, this will restrict traffic
     through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to the
     specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does
     not support the feature." More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/

   ports        <[]Object>
     The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

   publishNotReadyAddresses     <boolean>
     publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS
     implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the
     Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The
     primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless
     Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their
     readiness for purpose of peer discovery.

   selector     <map[string]string>
     Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this
     selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an
     external process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify.
     Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if
     type is ExternalName. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/

   sessionAffinity      <string>
     Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity. Enable
     client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to
     None. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

   sessionAffinityConfig        <Object>
     sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session affinity.

   type <string>
     type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
     options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
     "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a
     cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are
     determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual
     construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP
     is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
     than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on
     every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort
     and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
     which routes to the clusterIP. More info:
     https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services---service-types
